# String Methods

```js
let name = "Nikitas";
name.length;
```
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length. For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1]. (Like python)

```js
string.toLowerCase()

string.toUpperCase()
```
